# Dynamic Weather App
A responsive web application that fetches and displays current weather information for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The design is inspired by the modern glassmorphism UI trend, ensuring a clean and visually appealing experience that automatically adapts to various device screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

## ‚ú® Features

* **Real-time Weather Data:** Displays current temperature (¬∞C), weather description, humidity, wind speed (km/h), "feels like" temperature, and atmospheric pressure (hPa).
* **City Search:** Easily search for weather in any city worldwide.
* **Dynamic Icons:** Weather conditions are represented by corresponding animated icons from OpenWeatherMap.
* **Current Date & Time:** Shows the localized date and time for the searched city.
* **Responsive Glassmorphism Design:** Optimized for seamless viewing and interaction across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using CSS Media Queries, Flexbox, and a frosted glass (glassmorphism) aesthetic.
* **Error Handling:** Provides user-friendly messages for "city not found," API key issues, or network problems.
* **Loading Indicator:** Displays a spinner animation while fetching weather data.
* **Default City Load:** Shows weather for "New Delhi" on initial page load (can be customized).

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Structured the web page content semantically.
* **CSS3:** Styled the application, implementing the glassmorphism design, responsive layouts with `flexbox` and `grid`, and `@media` queries for different screen sizes.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Handled API requests using `fetch()`, parsed JSON responses, dynamically updated the DOM, and managed application state.
* **OpenWeatherMap API:** The public API used for fetching comprehensive weather data.
* **Font Awesome:** Utilized for various icons (search, humidity, wind, error, loading, thermometer, cloud).
* **Google Fonts (Poppins):** For modern and legible typography throughout the application.
